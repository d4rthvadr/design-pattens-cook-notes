### What's about

This repository is dedicated to exploring and understanding design patterns in JavaScript. It provides examples, notes, and use cases to help developers learn when and how to apply design patterns effectively, as well as when to avoid them.

### Summary

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. This repository focuses on implementing these patterns in JavaScript, offering practical examples and insights into their usage. Each pattern is accompanied by a detailed explanation, code examples, and scenarios where it is most applicable.

I will be updating it from time to time as i find new ways of using them.

### Running examples /{pattern-dir}/example-{xx}.ts

```shell
cd `/decorator`
npx ts-node example-00.ts
```

- Situations where simpler solutions are more effective.

#### 5. Notes and Best Practices

- Key considerations when implementing patterns.
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

#### 6. Examples

- Each pattern includes one or more example files.
- Example format: `/pattern-dir/example-{xx}.ts`.
